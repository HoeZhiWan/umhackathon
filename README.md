Chappy is our submission for UMHackathon Domain 3 Task 2: MEX Assistant â€“ Insights. It provides an AI-powered assistant for Grab Food merchants, helping them understand business performance, optimize operations, and manage their menu items through a conversational interface.

Our solution is designed to meet the key evaluation criteria:
- **Insight Quality and Relevance:** Providing actionable, prioritized insights
- **Communication Effectiveness:** Explaining complex data in simple terms with visual support
- **User Experience and Engagement:** Creating natural conversation flows with quick response times

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chat Assistant**: Built with Gemini AI for natural language interactions
- **Multi-Language Support**: Automatically detects and adapts to user language
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Dynamic charts and graphs for business analytics
- **Menu Item Management**: Create and preview new menu items with AI-generated descriptions and images
- **Merchant Selector**: Switch between different merchant accounts
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive grid layout for different screen sizes

## How It Works

### Intent Recognition and Function Calling

Chappy uses Google's Gemini AI to understand merchant queries and determine their intent. Based on the detected intent, the system will:

1. **Call appropriate functions** to retrieve relevant business data (e.g., sales trends, peak hours, top-selling items)
2. **Process and analyze data** to extract meaningful insights
3. **Generate visualizations** that help merchants understand the data at a glance
4. **Provide actionable recommendations** based on the analyzed data

For example, when a merchant asks about their sales performance, Gemini will:
- Identify this as a sales analysis request
- Call functions to retrieve historical sales data
- Generate charts showing trends and patterns
- Highlight key insights such as peak selling times or best-performing items

### Menu Item Management

Merchants can add new menu items through a conversational interface:
- Simply describe the new item to Chappy
- Gemini will extract relevant details and format them appropriately
- AI-generated descriptions and images are created based on the item details
- Merchants can preview and confirm before the item is added to their menu

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](public/README/architecture_design.png)

The application follows a modern, serverless architecture with:
- Next.js App Router for frontend and API routes
